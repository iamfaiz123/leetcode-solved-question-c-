## I have been solving DSA question a lot since past year But since i joined my current organization i don't get much time to do as i spend lot of my free time in backend , blockchain and system Design

Well altough i am familiar with javascript , Python and Rust
but when it comes to DSA c++ is my choice, Javascript and python is dynamic type language so it becomes pain to understand the flow sometimes.
rust is good but its functional programming and borrow checker system becomes bane to write code somethings that is why c++ is best choice for writing small code.

## why? 
>1. well c++ STL provides seamless datastructure and easy methods.
>2. nothing beats c++ speed, hmmmm? i know rust is faster than c++ but it hard to do DSA on rust :>
>3. debugging in c++ easy, again not as easy in rust, still compare to other languages it is easy
>4. DSA was taught me in c only so i extended my knowledge to c++

Well if you know DSA its easy to implement irrespective of language, sometimes i use python and javascript too.
