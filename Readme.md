## I love to solved DSA questions a lot

Well altough i am familiar with javascript , Python and Rust
but when it comes to DSA c++ is my choice

## why? 
>1. well c++ STL provides seamless datastructure and easy methods.
>2. nothing beats c++ speed, hmmmm? i know rust is faster than c++ but it hard to do DSA on rust :>
>3. debugging in c++ easy, again not as easy in rust, still compare to other languages it is easy
>4. DSA was taught me in c only so i extended my knowledge to c++

Well if you know DSA its easy to implement irrespective of language, sometimes i use python and javascript too.
